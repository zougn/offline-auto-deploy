D3 supports a wide variety of common and [unusual](https://github.com/d3/d3-geo-projection) map projections. And because D3 uses spherical geometry to represent data, you can apply any aspect to any projection by rotating geometry.\n\n## Resources\n\n- [Documentation](https://d3js.org/d3-geo)\n- [Examples](https://observablehq.com/collection/@d3/d3-geo)\n- [Releases](https://github.com/d3/d3-geo/releases)\n- [Getting help](https://d3js.org/community)\n","time":{"created":"2022-01-26T13:40:43.161Z","modified":"2024-03-12T22:32:22.888Z","2.0.2":"2021-06-09T14:37:24.660Z","3.0.1":"2021-06-05T18:17:52.269Z","3.0.0":"2021-06-05T17:03:49.056Z","2.0.1":"2020-08-26T19:33:07.062Z","2.0.0":"2020-08-23T14:54:20.207Z","2.0.0-rc.2":"2020-07-30T09:45:24.080Z","2.0.0-rc.1":"2020-07-27T09:37:41.359Z","1.12.1":"2020-05-27T08:00:43.798Z","1.12.0":"2020-04-18T20:01:15.562Z","1.11.9":"2019-11-16T18:34:55.595Z","1.11.8":"2019-11-12T07:03:15.533Z","1.11.7":"2019-11-07T17:05:05.008Z","1.11.6":"2019-06-21T20:20:01.657Z","1.11.5":"2019-06-21T16:08:42.751Z","1.11.4":"2019-06-21T15:42:34.847Z","1.11.3":"2018-11-26T21:21:45.535Z","1.11.2":"2018-11-24T19:50:48.763Z","1.11.1":"2018-08-24T21:27:23.434Z","1.11.0":"2018-08-24T19:15:08.403Z","1.10.0":"2018-03-14T17:16:51.088Z","1.9.1":"2017-12-08T21:15:10.978Z","1.9.0":"2017-10-05T16:31:31.917Z","1.8.1":"2017-09-30T20:57:09.476Z","1.7.1":"2017-09-13T13:46:32.339Z","1.7.0":"2017-09-12T19:41:34.866Z","1.6.4":"2017-05-16T14:25:21.421Z","1.6.3":"2017-03-13T03:42:08.580Z","1.6.2":"2017-03-10T18:01:42.976Z","1.6.1":"2017-03-02T20:30:25.960Z","1.6.0":"2017-02-28T18:01:50.285Z","1.5.0":"2017-02-19T16:55:48.132Z","1.4.2":"2017-02-18T17:11:23.553Z","1.4.1":"2017-02-09T18:56:42.568Z","1.4.0":"2016-11-16T17:41:31.252Z","1.3.1":"2016-10-27T18:41:36.793Z","1.3.0":"2016-10-27T17:30:35.455Z","1.2.6":"2016-10-11T15:48:01.284Z","1.2.5":"2016-09-20T20:10:44.794Z","1.2.4":"2016-08-20T16:03:47.324Z","1.2.3":"2016-08-15T18:27:14.082Z","1.2.2":"2016-08-02T21:45:42.642Z","1.2.1":"2016-08-02T21:09:05.515Z","1.2.0":"2016-07-29T22:30:46.300Z","1.1.1":"2016-07-11T02:42:43.634Z","1.1.0":"2016-06-30T00:32:13.837Z","1.0.0":"2016-06-24T23:24:58.215Z","0.1.0":"2016-06-22T04:30:47.788Z","0.0.4":"2016-06-20T17:11:10.490Z","0.0.3":"2016-06-19T16:38:58.774Z","0.0.2":"2016-06-18T17:34:20.018Z","0.0.1":"2016-05-02T18:27:39.252Z","0.0.0":"2014-03-29T21:55:42.660Z","3.1.0":"2022-12-20T22:25:17.173Z","3.1.1":"2024-03-12T22:06:03.888Z"},"versions":{"2.0.2":{"name":"d3-geo","version":"2.0.2","description":"Shapes and calculators for spherical coordinates.","keywords":["d3","d3-module","geo","maps","cartography"],"homepage":"https://d3js.org/d3-geo/","license":"BSD-3-Clause","author":{"name":"Mike Bostock","url":"https://bost.ocks.org/mike"},"main":"dist/d3-geo.js","unpkg":"dist/d3-geo.min.js","jsdelivr":"dist/d3-geo.min.js","module":"src/index.js","repository":{"type":"git","url":"git+https://github.com/d3/d3-geo.git"},"scripts":{"pretest":"rollup -c","test":"tape -r esm 'test/**/*-test.js' && eslint src","prepublishOnly":"rm -rf dist && yarn test && mkdir -p test/output && test/compare-images","postpublish":"git push && git push --tags && cd ../d3.github.com && git pull && cp ../${npm_package_name}/dist/${npm_package_name}.js ${npm_package_name}.v${npm_package_version%%.*}.js && cp ../${npm_package_name}/dist/${npm_package_name}.min.js ${npm_package_name}.v${npm_package_version%%.*}.min.js && git add ${npm_package_name}.v${npm_package_version%%.*}.js ${npm_package_name}.v${npm_package_version%%.*}.min.js && git commit -m \"${npm_package_name} ${npm_package_version}\" && git push && cd -
