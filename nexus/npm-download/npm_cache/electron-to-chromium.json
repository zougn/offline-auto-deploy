A major or full Electron version.\n\nA function that returns the corresponding Chromium version for a given Electron function. Returns a string.\n\nIf you provide it with a major Electron version, it will return a major Chromium version:\n\n```js\nvar chromeVersion = e2c.electronToChromium('1.4');\n// chromeVersion is \"53\"\n```\n\nIf you provide it with a full Electron version, it will return the full Chromium version.\n\n```js\nvar chromeVersion = e2c.electronToChromium('1.4.11');\n// chromeVersion is \"53.0.2785.143\"\n```\n\nIf a query does not match a Chromium version, it will return `undefined`.\n\n```js\nvar chromeVersion = e2c.electronToChromium('9000');\n// chromeVersion is undefined\n```\n\n#### `chromiumToElectron(query)`\nArguments:\n* Query: string or number, required. A major or full Chromium version.\n\nReturns a string with the corresponding Electron version for a given Chromium query.\n\nIf you provide it with a major Chromium version, it will return a major Electron version:\n\n```js\nvar electronVersion = e2c.chromiumToElectron('54');\n// electronVersion is \"1.4\"\n```\n\nIf you provide it with a full Chrome version, it will return an array of full Electron versions.\n\n```js\nvar electronVersions = e2c.chromiumToElectron('56.0.2924.87');\n// electronVersions is [\"1.6.3\", \"1.6.2\", \"1.6.1\", \"1.6.0\"]\n```\n\nIf a query does not match an Electron version, it will return `undefined`.\n\n```js\nvar electronVersion = e2c.chromiumToElectron('10');\n// electronVersion is undefined\n```\n\n#### `electronToBrowserList(query)` **DEPRECATED**\nArguments:\n* Query: string or number, required. A major Electron version.\n\n_**Deprecated**: Browserlist already includes electron-to-chromium._\n\nA function that returns a [Browserslist](https://github.com/ai/browserslist) query that matches the given major Electron version. Returns a string.\n\nIf you provide it with a major Electron version, it will return a Browserlist query string that matches the Chromium capabilities:\n\n```js\nvar query = e2c.electronToBrowserList('1.4');\n// query is \"Chrome >= 53\"\n```\n\nIf a query does not match a Chromium version, it will return `undefined`.\n\n```js\nvar query = e2c.electronToBrowserList('9000');\n// query is undefined\n```\n\n### Importing just versions, fullVersions, chromiumVersions and fullChromiumVersions\nAll lists can be imported on their own, if file size is a concern.\n\n#### `versions`\n\n```js\nvar versions = require('electron-to-chromium/versions');\n```\n\n#### `fullVersions`\n\n```js\nvar fullVersions = require('electron-to-chromium/full-versions');\n```\n\n#### `chromiumVersions`\n\n```js\nvar chromiumVersions = require('electron-to-chromium/chromium-versions');\n```\n\n#### `fullChromiumVersions`\n\n```js\nvar fullChromiumVersions = require('electron-to-chromium/full-chromium-versions');\n```\n\n## Updating\nThis package will be updated with each new Electron release.\n\nTo update the list, run `npm run build.js`. Requires internet access as it downloads from the canonical list of Electron versions.\n\nTo verify correct behaviour, run `npm test`.\n\n\n## License\n[![FOSSA
